-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The backgrounds are all building themed to keep with the business. All hover.css features are the colour of slategray and a brick red.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a popular font at the moment and is clean and easily read.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is key with this website as it is more of a showcase. All images used are related to building as that is what the business is. The gallery page is also shaped in a paving slab design to keep with the building aesthetic.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the business.

        1. As soon as the website is opened the user can see a visible, clear navigation bar that allows them to go to any page of their choice. The business logo is also within this navbar.
        2. They are greeted with an instant description of who and what the business is and does.
        3. The user can choose to either check out the gallery section then go to the contact page or they can instantly email/contact them through the social media links on the footer which is fixed to the bottom of the page.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The user has the navbar at the top of the page on all pages, the pages are clearly named allowing the user to easily know what page their going to. This will avoid the user feeling or getting trapped.
        2. After submitting the form it will refresh the page back to the contact page so the navigation bar will always be there to help people navigate around the website after they have used it.
        3. The social media icons will open up a new tab which will allow the user to keep the original website open allowing them to return to where they were before they clicked on the icon.  

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily get in contact with the business if i have any queries.

        1. There is a form that can be filled out on the contact page if the user wishes to ask any questions.
        2. Also there is a tab at the bottom of the page which also opens up another email option. This is next to the social media icons which can also be used to contact or find out more about the business.
       
### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.
